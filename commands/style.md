description: Learn the user's WhatsApp writing style from their own message history and save it as a reusable profile
---

Build a writing-style profile from the user's own sent WhatsApp messages, so future drafted/sent messages match how they actually write — not a generic AI tone.

## 1. Scope the sample

If more than one `whatsapp*` MCP server is configured (see `~/.claude.json`), ask which account to learn from.

Ask with AskUserQuestion: "Which chats should I learn from?" — options like "A specific chat" (then ask for it) / "General — sample across recent chats" / "Skip a chat I name" (for cases where one contact's tone shouldn't count, e.g. a work channel with a very different register than personal chats).

Also ask sample size loosely: "How many of your own messages should I read? (more = more accurate, slower)" — default suggestion 150-300 if the user has no preference.

## 2. Pull messages

Use `list_messages` (via the resolved `mcp__<server>__list_messages` tool) with `include_context: false` to keep the read light. If scoped to one chat, pass `chat_jid`. If general, use a large `limit` per page (e.g. 100) rather than the tool's small default — small pages mean many round trips before enough `From: Me:` lines accumulate.

Each returned line is formatted `[timestamp] Chat: X From: Y: content`. Keep only lines where the sender is the user (`From: Me:` — matches how `format_message` in this codebase marks the user's own messages). Discard everyone else's lines; they're context, not signal.

Discard every line from `status@broadcast` outright, general sample or not — it's WhatsApp's status/stories feed, not a conversation, and it can dominate a general sample by sheer volume (contact status updates land there constantly) while carrying zero conversational-style signal. If a general sample is heavy on it and light on real "From: Me:" lines, that's the signal to keep paging rather than assume the account has little to learn from.

Skip media placeholders (`[image - ...]`, `[audio - ...]`) and near-empty messages (single-word acks, reaction-forwards) — they don't carry style. Keep the actual sentences.

## 3. Synthesize the profile

Read through the collected sent messages and describe, concretely, how this person actually writes — not a generic style guide. Look for:

- **Length**: short bursts vs long paragraphs vs mixed by context
- **Formality**: slang, regionalisms, how they address people (nickname vs name)
- **Punctuation habits**: do they use periods at the end of casual messages? Ellipses? All-lowercase?
- **Emoji**: none / occasional / heavy, and which ones recur
- **Structure**: single message vs habitually splitting one thought across several consecutive messages (very common on WhatsApp — check if THIS user does it)
- **Openers/closers**: how they start and end messages, if there's a pattern
- **What they don't do**: e.g. never uses exclamation points, never says "olá", always skips greetings and gets straight to the point

Write this as a short, concrete profile (bullet points, not prose essay) — something specific enough that reading it back tells you exactly how to write AS this person, not generic advice like "be friendly."

## 4. Save it

Save the profile as a `feedback`-type memory (per this project's memory conventions — see the global memory system instructions) named something like `whatsapp-writing-style`, with `description` noting it governs how Claude drafts/sends WhatsApp messages for this user. Include in the memory body: when it was generated, roughly how many messages/which scope it was based on, and the profile itself.

Tell the user it's saved and will apply automatically to future `send_message`/drafted messages — no need to re-explain their style each time. Mention they can re-run `/whatsapp:style` later if their writing changes or the profile feels off, and the old memory will be updated (not duplicated — check for the existing memory file first per the "don't write duplicate memories" rule).
